OpenFDEM Post-Processing Documentation
======================================

The documentation is generated using Sphinx. The corresponding Python packages can be installed using:
`
pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
`

The [web documentation](build/html/index.html) is built using:
`
make html
`
and uses the "Read the Docs" theme.

A user reference and a programmer reference is separated to organize the functions that are specifically for implementation of the Post-Processing code.

The web reference is built using the command
`make html`
