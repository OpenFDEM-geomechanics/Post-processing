# FDEM Post-Processing Package
### University of Toronto, 2021

### Support
This Python package performs transformations on hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) models with an unstructured grid in vtk/vtu/vtp format. It currently supports arrays of simulation files from the FDEM solvers:
- [Irazu](https://www.geomechanica.com/software/),
- [Y-Geo](https://geogroup.utoronto.ca/software/) (and its common derivatives), as well as 
- [OpenFDEM](https://openfdem.com/html/index.html).

### Functionality
Functions include:
- Extract information within the FDEM Model based on the name of the array (e.g., Stress, Strain, Temperature, etc...)

- Extract stress-strain information for UCS and BD Simulations. Optional addition of virtual strain gauges.

- Plotting stress vs strain curve.

</p>

- Calculate the Elastic Modulus of the dataset. Eavg, Esec and Etan can be evaluated. 

- Extract information of a particular cell based on a sequence of array names. This can be extended to extracting information along a line.

- Extraction of information for cells/thresholds extended to 3D Models as well. 

- Automatic detection of loading direction when analysing mechanical simulations, namely UCS, BD, and PLT, in both 2D and 3D simulations
