OpenFDEM Objectives and Future plans

DONE for UCS

Platen tracking (Should track any body of intact elements)
- Force (x y z directions)
- Displacement (x y z directions)
- Velocity xyz
- Contact area (should be separate function?)

Strain gauge analysis
- input: Location, direction, length
- output: Strain gauge simulator?

Model processing utilities
- Stress/strain diagram
- Volumetric strain
- Elastic mod.
- Plotters


TODO

Need full OpenFDEM outputs for UCS/BD

BD processing

Fracture/fragment characterization
- Clustering
- Fracture timeline
- Fragment element groups

Seismic processing

Shear test
--- Contact locations
--- Monitoring points for seismicity asperity breakage

Documentation
- website
- combine with preprocessing and openfdem processing?
- creating a manual PDF from Sphinx?

Testing scripts?

Pre-processing UI
- Mesh from Geo file?
