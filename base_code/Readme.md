Calculates the Magnitude of the event and produces:
1. Time step vs. Event Energy colored based on Failure Mode
1. Histogram of Magnitudes
1. b-value curve of Cumulative and Individual event counts based on Magnitude.


#UPDATES

In V13 to V14
1. Understands the failure modes from 1 to 8 based on the new Irazu Manual.
1. Runs on venv 
1. Obseleted the specimen center by using modelbounds()
